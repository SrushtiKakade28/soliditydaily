9) Private / Public Functions-
uint[] numbers;

function _addToArray(uint _number) private {
  numbers.push(_number);
}
i)This means only other functions within our contract will be able to call this function and add to the numbers array.
ii) it's convention to start private function names with an underscore (_).
--------------------
10) Return-
string greeting = "What's up dog";

function sayHello() public returns (string memory) {
  return greeting;
}
i)In Solidity, the function declaration contains the type of the return value (in this case string).

--------------------
11)Function modifiers-
i)view-So in this case we could declare it as a view function, meaning it's only viewing the data but not modifying it:

function sayHello() public view returns (string memory) {
ii)Solidity also contains pure functions, which means you're not even accessing any data in the app. Consider the following:

function _multiply(uint a, uint b) private pure returns (uint) {
  return a * b;
}
